`dlmtree` is an R package that provides constrained distributed lag
models (DLMs) using a regression tree approach within the Bayesian
additive regression trees (BART) framework, referred to as treed DLMs.
The package includes various extensions of treed DLMs, allowing for the
incorporation of different scenarios like linear, non-linear
associations, mixture exposures, and heterogeneous exposure effects. The
package is built user-friendly with a single function with three
arguments to specify treed DLMs. Functions for summarizing the model fit
and visualization are also provided.
